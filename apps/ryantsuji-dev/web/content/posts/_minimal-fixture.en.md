Minimal test fixture used by `$slug.test.tsx`. No headings, no tags — covers the
null branches of TOC rendering and tag-list rendering in `routes/posts/$slug.tsx`.

Slugs prefixed with `_` are excluded from `/posts` listing (production publishing
surface) but remain reachable via direct `getPostSource(slug, lang)` so test
fixtures can be SSR'd without polluting the index.
